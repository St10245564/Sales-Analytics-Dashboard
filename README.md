## 📁 Dataset Description

The dataset contains **structured sales transaction data** organized into a well-defined schema with consistent rows and columns. Each entry follows a specific data type (dates, integers, or text), making it ideal for quantitative analysis of sales performance and trends.

| Column Name | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| **Order ID** | A unique alphanumeric identifier for each transaction, used to track individual orders and prevent duplication |
| **Product** | Identifies the specific item sold (e.g., Laptop, Smartphone), allowing the business to see which inventory items are most popular |
| **Region** | Identifies the geographical location (South African province) where the sale occurred, useful for regional performance mapping |
| **Units Sold** | A quantitative measure of the volume of items purchased in a single transaction |
| **Unit Price** | The cost of a single item at the time of sale, used to calculate total financial value |
| **Revenue** | The total income generated from the order; mathematically, it is the product of Units Sold × Unit Price |
| **Sales Rep** | Identifies the specific employee responsible for the sale, used to track staff performance and commissions |
| **Order Date** | Records the date the transaction took place, enabling time-series analysis like monthly growth or seasonal trends |

The data was cleaned and structured for analysis using Excel functions and pivot tables.
